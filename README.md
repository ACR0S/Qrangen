Add description

## Instructions

In order to do your own simulations with IBM servers, you need to obtain a personal token (See Qiskit Documentation for more info). Once you have this key, you need to store it in a file named `key.json` with the following structure:

```
{
	"api_token":<your_api_token>
}
```

A sample of this structure can be found in `example_key.json`.
